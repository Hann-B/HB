                    <p>Hello and welcome! I'm Hanna. I love bringing heads together, inventing solutions, and playing outside of the box.</p>
                    <p>
                        Currently, I am a .NET software developer living in St. Petersburg, Florida.
                        The programming avenue appealed to me because I was bored of living an unchallenging life as a waitress.
                        @dateDiff days ago, I took a leap of faith. Today's anticipation of the future is thrilling.

                        A history of B.S. (in Oceanography that is!) I am a loving daughter, sister, aunt, and dog momma with a passion to travel.
                        Addicted to new experiences and betterment of myself, as well as the community. I hope to help inspire and advance technologies globally.
